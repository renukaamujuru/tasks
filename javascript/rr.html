<h1 style="background-color:red;">Rarandoi Veduka Chuddam Review –</h1> Routine But Passable BOTTOM LINE Routine But Passable OUR <ul><li>RATING 2.75/5</li> <li>CENSOR ‘U/A’ Certified,</li> <li>2 hrs 30 mins</li>.</ul> <h2>What Is the Film About? </h2><p>Shiva (Naga Chaitanya) loves Brahmaramba (Rakul Preet Singh) after interaction with her at a marriage. Soon they meet again in Vizag where Brahmaramba comes to study she makes it clear that there is no interest in love for her.</p><p> How Shiva manages to win her over is what the film is all about?<a href="http:www.google.com"> How Is Naga Chaitanya’s Performance?</a> Naga Chaitanya repeats his performance in a different kind of film. He has acted similarly in past in films, Thadaka or Premam, it is the set up of the movie that is different, otherwise, everything else about him is routine. Not that it is a bad quality but it is nothing special as promised.</p> <p>Towards the end, there are a couple of scenes which would have really stood out in terms of performance. Naga Chaitanya did well but in the immediate scenes that follow where seniors hit it out of the park with emotions even in a routine scene, one realizes how less he has done. </p><p>Only then we realize it’s the dialogues rather than the acting that we got connected to. Direction by Kalyan Krishna? Kalyan Krishna made a fantastic debut with the film Soggade Chinni Nayana. It was a routine affair but the way it is executed brings freshness to viewers. He follows a similar approach with Rarandoi Veduka Chuddam as well only here the leads aren’t as charming as his debut.</p> <p>Despite a routine and predictable story, the film is packed with enough moments that are enough to grab the audience attention. All the elements to entertain are present but the impact is not felt. The narrative feels rushed at important points and at times the sheer predictability makes things uninteresting. The big solace is even with the available cast the movie gets going and doesn’t drag or bore endlessly. There are a few scenes in between which do work and that is enough to categorize this as an average entertainer.</p>
