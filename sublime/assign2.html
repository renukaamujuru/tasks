<h4>PLOT SPOILER</h4>
<font color="red">Spoiler alert! Please do not read the following plot summary if you have not seen the film.</font>
<p>Sachin Tendulkar(Sachin, himself) was a naughty child growing up in Bandra’s MIG area. He was the fourth child of his parents—Ramesh and Rajini Tendulkar. His older brothers were Nitin and Ajit and his sister was Savita. All of them spoilt Sachin silly because he was a really cute but also a precocious child. However Sachin also had one special skill. He showed signs of becoming a great cricketer even as before he reached his teens.</p>

<p>His elder brother Nitin took him to meet Ramakant Achrekar at Shivaji Park and told him about his brother’s special abilities. Achrekar Sir started training Sachin and from there on the boy was on a winning spree. At home, his second brother Ajit trained him. Sachin worked so hard at his game that the entire family took care of him. They got him to live with his uncle and aunt at Shivaji Park so he could remain closer to the ground where he played his practice matches.</p>

<p>Before he knew it, Sachin was selected to represent India and at the age of 16, he was already a sensation. Teams like Pakistan and Australia who underestimated him, thinking he was a little child who was fit to only play gully cricket, were shocked when he displayed unusual talent with the bat. He later on became an important all- rounder because of his ability to bowl and also being an important fielder.</p>

<p>His cricket career continued uninterrupted for nearly twenty-two years. From 1989 to 2011. Sachin created so many records that he is often referred to as the greatest batsman of all times in India and overseas.</p>

<p>India also conferred him with the Bharat Ratna, the highest civilian award and he was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2012. Of course his highs were accompanied by many lows. He suffered some serious injuries and played for India despite nursing a tennis elbow between 2004 and 2006. He had two stints at captaincy but he was burdened with the role of the captain and found his on-field performances were better when he was not wearing that crown.</p>

<h3>SPOILER ALERT:</h3>

<p>Sachin wanted to retire when he suffered some serious injuries but he prayed to Lord Ganesha that before he stopped being an ``active’’ part of the Indian cricket squad, he wanted to pick up a world cup for India. In 2011, he got that opportunity. When India won, Sachin was a happy man.
He is now the coach of the Mumbai Indians, IPL team.</p>
